# Chapter 2 - Multi-armed Bandits

## Exercise 2.1  
In ε-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and ε = 0.5, what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?
```
Solution 2.1  
Probablity of selecting non greedy action = ε * selecting non greedy action among two actions = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25  
Probability of selecting the greedy action  = 1 - Probability of selecting non greedy action = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75  
```
